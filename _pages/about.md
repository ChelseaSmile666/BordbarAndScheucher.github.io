Summary of the Meta-Analysis
======

Focus of the Study:
------
To find out wether standalone smartphone apps for mental health are effective in reducing symptoms of mental health disorders and self-injurious thoughts.

Target Group:
------
People with heightened symptoms of mental health disorders (for eg. Depression, Anxiety, ...) who have problems with visiting a therapist due to various reasons.

Relevant Stakeholders:
------
Mainly psychological researchers, psychiatrists and software developers.

Average Effect Size:
------
Small significant effect on Depression (Hedges g = 0.33)
Small significant effect on smoking behaviour (Hedges g = 0.39).

Additional Results:
------
No significant results for the efficacy of standalone smartphone apps for drinking, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, suicide ideation and self-injurious thoughts and behaviours (g = −0.14 to 0.18).

Why is this topic important?
======
In today's day and age mental disorders are [highly prevalent](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health) and undertreated. 
People don't seek help for various reasons (even in higher economy households). 
The reason for that are structural treatment barriers and attitudinal factors. 
Researchers of the study say that those attitudinal factors play a bigger role in this behaviour than structural treatment barriers. 
To help reducing those barriers smartphones could be used. Since a lot of people use their smartphone on a daily basis, there is also a huge interest in developing apps which try to improve the mental health of the users. This brings several advantages. Smartphones can be used with low effort and do not demand a lot of time. Also people do not have to talk to a person face to face and can use it anonymously. This can lead to less fear of stigmatization and therefore reduce the barriers individuals in need of treatment face by a lot. Also low income countries [where resources for mental health is greatly limited](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S2215036616300244?token=D1889E742F3EEF16D044C641067431556B3FD855B21E5DA59994AB7A6631F07A4716AE776353C394E5F11DAECB558BE5&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20220514153347) can profitate a lot with the use of smartphone apps targeting mental health issues. Another aspect for the importance of this is that [mHealth](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/gemeinschaften-umsetzung/ehealth-aktivitaeten/mhealth.html#:~:text=«mHealth»%20ist%20ein%20besonderer%20Aspekt,Patientendossier%20(EPD)%20zu%20nutzen.) (mobile-eHealth) could reach people who otherwise would not seek help [reference-link](https://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/31262/3/EFPA%20paper%20V2%20JT%20%281%29.pdf). Also it has the advantage to help individuals to apply treatment-related skills in real life situations. 
Due to the rising amount of health apps joining the market, it is important to also look at the effects of those apps. [A German study from 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lasse-Sander-4/publication/325451433_Hilfe_aus_dem_App-Store_Eine_systematische_Ubersichtsarbeit_und_Evaluation_von_Apps_zur_Anwendung_bei_Depressionen/links/5bc5f347299bf17a1c55add1/Hilfe-aus-dem-App-Store-Eine-systematische-Uebersichtsarbeit-und-Evaluation-von-Apps-zur-Anwendung-bei-Depressionen.pdf) only 11% out of 38 apps for depression showed some face validity and no evidence on effectiveness and safety. 
Even though smartphone apps are praised for the potentional revolution for mental health treatments, there are some downsides to it. 
These are: [screen size, battery life, system updates, technology requirements, technology requirements, usage patterns, competition between apps, short app lifespans, non private settings and data security concerns](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0188-8.pdf?origin=ppub).
Even though this smartphone apps for mental health issues are emerging since 10 years there is little research in the efficacy of them. Therefore this study conducted a meta-analysis of studies which analyse the effects of standalone psychological interventions for mental health via the smartphone. The researchered variables include the reduction of symptoms of mental disorders and self-injurious thoughts and behaviours in adults with heightened symptom severity. The studies included in this meta-analysis were all assessed via self-measurement tools and all studies were conduncted in high-income countries.

Results
======

The study could identify 19 eligible trials which evaluated the efficacy of a smarthphone app to help treating mental health symptoms in a randomized controlled trial. Significant pooled effects could be found for depression (g=0.33) and smoking (g=0.39), which are rather small effect sizes. No significant pooled effects were found for anxiety, alcohol use and self-injurious thoughts and behaviour. Also both trials which targeted PTSD symptoms showed no significant effects. When exploring depression and axniety, regardless wheter this was the primary aim of the the intervention, pooled effecs were significant (anxiety: g=0.43, depression: g=0.34)

Quality of the Meta-Analysis
======

 Magnitude
------
Effects are relatively low. Ranging from significant pooled effects g = 0.33 (Depression) to g = 0.39 (smoking behaviour) they are not that compelling. Significant effects on insomnia are more compelling with Hedges g = 0.72 to 0.84, though these are from single trials since there weren’t enough comparisons to get pooled effects

Articulation
------ 
Precise and good understandable

Generality
------ 
Pretty general since they targeted a broad spectrum of mental health issue apps. The effects for PTSD and insomnia couldn’t be pooled.

Interestingness
------ 
The results of this meta analysis are relevant to particular stakeholders. If apps can help ease mental health sympoms or help stop smoking/drinking a lot of people could be helped that normally wouldn’t have access to therapy etc.. 

Credibility
------ 
Biases addressed, transparent study selection, transparent quality assessment by two independent researchers.

Conclusion
======
Only 19 Trials were selected although there is a big bandwith of mental health apps on the consumer market. This is in line with previous studys. 
These findings indicate that the growing body of evidence supporting digital mental health interventions delivered via the internet as an effective method of treating mental illness cannot be directly extended to digital interventions delivered via standalone mobile apps for all mental illnesses. However apps that target mental health issues still seem to reduce symptoms of certain illnesses. For these apps to work as a standalone therapy or substitute for professional interventions there is still a lot to be done and it shouldn’t be recommended to rely on these apps alone.
