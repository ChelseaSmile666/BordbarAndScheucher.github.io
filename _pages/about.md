Why is this topic important?
======
In today's day and age mental disorders are [highly prevalent](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health) and undertreated. 
People don't seek help for various reasons (even in higher economy households). 
The reason for that are structural treatment barriers and attitudinal factors. 
Researchers of the study say that those attitudinal factors play a bigger role in this behaviour than structural treatment barriers. 
To help reducing those barriers smartphones could be used. Since a lot of people use their smartphone on a daily basis, there is also a huge interest in developing apps which try to improve the mental health of the users. This brings several advantages. Smartphones can be used with low effort and do not demand a lot of time. Also people do not have to talk to a person face to face and can use it anonymously. This can lead to less fear of stigmatization and therefore reduce the barriers individuals in need of treatment face by a lot. Also low income countries [where resources for mental health is greatly limited](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S2215036616300244?token=D1889E742F3EEF16D044C641067431556B3FD855B21E5DA59994AB7A6631F07A4716AE776353C394E5F11DAECB558BE5&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20220514153347) can profitate a lot with the use of smartphone apps targeting mental health issues. Another aspect for the importance of this is that [mHealth](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/gemeinschaften-umsetzung/ehealth-aktivitaeten/mhealth.html#:~:text=«mHealth»%20ist%20ein%20besonderer%20Aspekt,Patientendossier%20(EPD)%20zu%20nutzen.) (mobile-eHealth) could reach people who otherwise would not seek help [reference-link](https://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/31262/3/EFPA%20paper%20V2%20JT%20%281%29.pdf). Also it has the advantage to help individuals to apply treatment-related skills in real life situations. 
Due to the rising amount of health apps joining the market, it is important to also look at the effects of those apps. [A German study from 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lasse-Sander-4/publication/325451433_Hilfe_aus_dem_App-Store_Eine_systematische_Ubersichtsarbeit_und_Evaluation_von_Apps_zur_Anwendung_bei_Depressionen/links/5bc5f347299bf17a1c55add1/Hilfe-aus-dem-App-Store-Eine-systematische-Uebersichtsarbeit-und-Evaluation-von-Apps-zur-Anwendung-bei-Depressionen.pdf) only 11% out of 38 apps for depression showed some face validity and no evidence on effectiveness and safety. 
Even though smartphone apps are praised for the potentional revolution for mental health treatments, there are some downsides to it. 
These are: [screen size, battery life, system updates, technology requirements, technology requirements, usage patterns, competition between apps, short app lifespans, non private settings and data security concerns](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0188-8.pdf?origin=ppub).
Even though this smartphone apps for mental health issues are emerging since 10 years there is little in the efficacy of them. Therefore this study conducted a meta-analysis of studies which analyse the effects of standalone psychological interventions for mental health via the smartphone. The researchered variables include the reduction of symptoms of mental disorders and self-injurious thoughts and behaviours in adults with heightened symptom severity.
