Why is this topic important?
======
In today's day and age mental disorders are [highly prevalent](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health) and undertreated. 
People don't seek help for various reasons (even in higher economy households). 
The reason for that are structural treatment barriers and attitudinal factors. 
Researchers of the study say that those attitudinal factors play a bigger role in this behaviour than structural treatment barriers. 
To help reducing those barriers smartphones could be used. Since a lot of people use their smartphone on a daily basis, there is also a huge interest in developing apps which try to improve the mental health of the users. This brings several advantages. Smartphones can be used with low effort and do not demand a lot of time. Also people do not have to talk to a person face to face and can use it anonymously. This can lead to less fear of stigmatization and therefore reduce the barriers individuals in need of treatment face by a lot.
