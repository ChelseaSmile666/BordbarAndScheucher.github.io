## Our Favourite Studies:

* Nathalie Scheucher
------
The study of Roepke et al. (2015) looks at the efficacy of smartphone/web based intervention when it comes to depressive symptoms. Through randomized controlled trial an intervention called SuperBetter (SB), which is accessed via smartphone and/or the SB Web site was evaluated. 283 adult iPhone users that had significant depression symptoms according to the Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D) were asked to complete the study. 
They were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) a version of SB using cognitive-behavioral therapy and positive psychotherapy strategies to target depression (CBT-PPT SB) 2) a general SB version focused on self-esteem and acceptance (General SB)
3) a waiting list control group (WL). 
The two SB groups were instructed to use the SB-app for 10 minutes daily for 1 month. All participants completed psychological distress and well-being measures online every 2 weeks through follow-up.

**Results**: SB participants achieved greater reductions in CES-D scores than WL participants by posttest (Cohenâ€™s d = 0.67) and by follow-up (d = 1.05). Contrary to prediction, CBT-PPT SB did not perform better than General SB; both versions of SB were more effective than the WL control. Differences between SB versions favored General SB but were not statistically significant.
