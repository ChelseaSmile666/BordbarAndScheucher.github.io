## Our Favourite Studies:

The study of Roepke et al. (2015) looks at the efficacy of smartphone/web based intervention when it comes to depressive symptoms. Through randomized controlled trial an intervention called SuperBetter (SB), which is accessed via smartphone and/or the SB Web site the efficacy of SB was evaluated. 283 adult iPhone users that had significant depression symptoms according to the Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D) were asked to complete the study. 

They were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 
1) a version of SB using cognitive-behavioral therapy and positive psychotherapy strategies to target depression (CBT-PPT SB)
2) a general SB version focused on self-esteem and acceptance (General SB)
3) a waiting list control group (WL). 
The two SB groups were instructed to use the SB-app for 10 minutes daily for 1 month. All participants completed psychological distress and well-being measures online every 2 weeks through follow-up.

Process of the study:

**Results:** 
SB participants achieved greater reductions in CES-D scores than WL participants by posttest (Cohenâ€™s d = 0.67) and by follow-up (d = 1.05). Contrary to prediction, CBT-PPT SB did not perform better than General SB. However both versions of SB were more effective than the WL control.

**Conclusion:**
Considering the high attrition rate and the motivated, self-selected sample, these large effect sizes should be interpreted cautiously. Self-help via smartphones/the Internet may nevertheless have a significant impact on the treatment of depression.

The Study of Hur et al. (2018) was conducted to introdice and verify a new smartphone app which directly intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This is done by recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios and giving direct advise to the main character. This study included 31 participants with other specified depressive disorder which were randomly allocated to either the treatment group Todac Todac (TT) or a daily mood chart app program (control group: CG). The participants were asked to use the app for 3 weeks daily and the clinical thoughts symptoms and autonomic thoughts were administered at baseline and a follow-up evaluation. The dysfunctional thoughts were assessed with the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, Depression with the Beck Depression Inventoriy II (BDI-II) and anxiety with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X2). Participants needed to meet following criteria: DSM-5 diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder (but no diagnosis of major depressive disorder), fluent in Korean, 12 or more years of education and being familiar with Internet and smartphone app use.
